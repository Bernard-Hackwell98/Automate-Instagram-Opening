# Automate-Instagram-Opening
In this I imported from 7 libraries except there are only 6 of them the open called password with username and password1 is a file I created that stores my instagram password and username and I didnot want to display it so I chose to put it in another file and use it. I hope the rest of the code is clear and easy to understand.
